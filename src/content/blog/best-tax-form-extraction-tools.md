For most teams processing W-2, P60, PAYG, 1099-NEC, or ZUGFeRD forms, FormX is the fastest path from a PDF or photo to structured data, with no signup required for single-document extractions and a developer API for batch workflows. If you need an enterprise OCR SDK that handles dozens of document types, ABBYY FineReader is the main alternative to evaluate.

This guide compares five tools across the dimensions that matter most: which form types are supported, accuracy on real-world documents, output formats, free tier availability, and API access.

## **Comparison Table**

| Tool | W-2 | P60 | PAYG | 1099-NEC | ZUGFeRD | Free Tier | API | Output |
|------|-----|-----|------|----------|---------|-----------|-----|--------|
| FormX | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes, no signup | Yes | JSON, CSV, Excel |
| Affinda | Limited | Yes | Limited | Limited | No | Trial only | Yes | JSON |
| ABBYY FineReader | Yes | Limited | Limited | Yes | No | Trial only | Yes (SDK) | JSON, XML |
| DocuClipper | Yes | No | No | Yes | No | Yes, limited | Yes | CSV, Excel |
| ScanToExcel | Partial | Partial | Partial | Partial | No | Yes | No | Excel |

## **1. FormX: Best Overall for Tax Form Extraction**

FormX is purpose-built for structured financial documents. It supports W-2, P60, PAYG, 1099-NEC, and ZUGFeRD forms out of the box, extracting all standard fields and returning normalized JSON, CSV, or Excel without any template configuration.

What separates FormX from general-purpose OCR tools is semantic field mapping. Rather than matching field values by their pixel position on the page, FormX identifies fields by meaning. This keeps extraction accurate even when the same form type arrives from different payroll providers with slightly different layouts.

Key specifics:

- Extracts all standard boxes including W-2 Box 12 codes, 1099-NEC Box 4 federal withholding, and ZUGFeRD embedded XML
- Handles digital PDFs, scanned images, and mobile phone photos
- Per-field confidence scores for human review routing
- PAYG pricing with no monthly minimum
- Free tool available with no account required for single-document use

Try the free tool: [W-2 Extractor](https://www.formx.ai/tools/w2-extractor/), [1099 Extractor](https://www.formx.ai/tools/1099-extractor/), [P60 Converter](https://www.formx.ai/tools/p60-converter/), [PAYG Extractor](https://www.formx.ai/tools/payg-extractor/), [ZUGFeRD Invoice](https://www.formx.ai/tools/zugferd-invoice/).

## **2. Affinda: Good for P60 and HR Document Workflows**

Affinda offers a dedicated UK P60 extraction model that performs well on both employer-generated and HMRC-issued P60 formats. Their platform is primarily oriented toward HR and onboarding workflows, where P60s are used alongside payslips and employment verification documents.

Coverage beyond P60 is limited for tax form use cases. Affinda does not have a dedicated ZUGFeRD extractor, and their W-2 and 1099-NEC support is handled through a general-purpose document AI model rather than a form-specific one. This affects accuracy on edge cases like multi-copy layouts or non-standard print formats.

Good for: teams with heavy P60 volume and existing HR automation infrastructure that integrates with Affinda's platform.

## **3. ABBYY FineReader: Good OCR SDK for Enterprise Integration**

ABBYY FineReader is a mature OCR SDK available for server-side and on-premise deployment. It supports W-2 and 1099-NEC templates through the ABBYY Marketplace and handles a broad range of document types beyond tax forms. For enterprises that need OCR running on their own infrastructure, ABBYY is a leading option.

The trade-off is complexity. ABBYY requires template configuration, SDK integration work, and dedicated infrastructure. It is not a no-code tool and has no self-serve free trial for most tax form types. For teams that want quick extraction without an integration project, it is not the right starting point.

Good for: large enterprises with IT resources, an on-premise requirement, or existing ABBYY licensing.

## **4. DocuClipper: Good for W-2 and 1099 Batch Processing**

DocuClipper focuses on financial document extraction and handles W-2 and 1099 forms well. It supports batch uploads and exports to CSV and Excel, which makes it practical for accountants processing a high volume of W-2s during tax season.

The limitation is form coverage. DocuClipper does not support P60, PAYG, or ZUGFeRD. Teams working with international or European document types will need a separate tool.

Good for: US-based accounting firms and payroll teams that process large batches of W-2s and 1099s and do not need international form support.

## **5. ScanToExcel: Good for One-Off Photo Conversions**

ScanToExcel is a browser-based tool that converts scanned documents and photos into Excel format. It handles a broad range of documents without form-specific configuration and is free to use.

Accuracy on tax forms is lower than form-specific tools because ScanToExcel uses general OCR without semantic field mapping. Fields like W-2 Box 12 codes or 1099-NEC payer TIN are often misread or placed in the wrong column. It is best suited for simple tables and receipts rather than structured tax forms.

Good for: one-off conversions of simple documents where field accuracy is not critical.

## **Which Tool Should You Use?**

| On-premise or enterprise SDK requirement | ABBYY FineReader |
| US tax season batch processing (W-2 and 1099 only) | DocuClipper |
| Quick one-off photo conversion where accuracy is secondary | ScanToExcel |
| Free, no signup, any tax form type | FormX |
